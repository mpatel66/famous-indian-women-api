# Famous Indian Women API



This is an api that returns basic information on one indian women (selected randomly) from a databse of 7k+ entries. The app is deployed on Heroku, and you can use [this endpoint](https://famous-indian-women.herokuapp.com/random) to make a get request for a random entry. 



**I came across the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore/7k-indian-famous-women), and all credit goes to the author ([Moore](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore)) for putting it togther and sharing it.**



## Todo

I'm using this project as playground to learn more about deployment and testing. Here's a rough list of some things I'd like to do:

- <strike>Deploy to heroku</strike>
- Add more (useful) endpoints!
- Add automated testing
